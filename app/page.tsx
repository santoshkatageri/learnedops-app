      <h2>DevOps Beyond Tools</h2>

      <p>
        LearnedOps is a calm, layered approach to understanding
        DevOps, careers, and money for engineers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We focus on systems, feedback loops, and long-term thinking —
        not tool chasing.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a course. It’s a thinking space.
