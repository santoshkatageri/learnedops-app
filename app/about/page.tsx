                    LearnedOps is a calm space for engineers to think clearly about
                    DevOps, careers, and money — beyond tools, trends, and shortcuts.

                <p className="mt-6 text-gray-600">
                    The focus here is not on what tools to use, but on how to make
                    better long-term decisions while building systems and careers.

                    This site shares real-world perspectives on DevOps beyond hype,
                    engineering growth over time, and financial stability for
                    professionals in tech.

                    LearnedOps is maintained by an engineer working with real
                    production systems. It is not a course platform or a consulting
                    pitch — just a long-term thinking space, built in public.
